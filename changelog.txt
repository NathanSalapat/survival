Started work on the two new "beds". Added beds as a dependency and am using that code for the time being to handle sleeping.

Added an ABM that changes some sand near water to survival:sand_with_food, which, as the name suggests, can contain some oysters or mussels. Added the oyster and mussels, along with their craft recipes. I'm debating over whether I should allow eating them raw in shell, or if they should have to be crafted out of the shell to eat raw, but left in shell to cook.

Started working on the system for creating tree sap, and coding the options that only allow the spigot to be placed on a tree.
